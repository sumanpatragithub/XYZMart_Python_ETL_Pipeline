-----------------------------

🚀 Excited to share insights into a powerful #DataPipeline! using python  📊 Here's a glimpse into the key stages:

💠 Data Extraction 🐍: We kick off with Python, extracting data from sources like CSVs. The gateway to our data journey!

💠 Data Cleaning 🧹: Ensuring top-notch quality by handling missing values, correcting errors, resolving inconsistencies, and bidding farewell to duplicates. Clean data, clear insights!

💠 Data Transformation 🔄: The metamorphosis begins! Formatting, aggregation, normalization, and some magic with feature engineering to mold the data for analysis.

💠 Data Modeling 🏗️: Crafting a data model that mirrors the intricate relationships within. Choosing the right model, be it relational, hierarchical, or more, depending on the use case.

💠 Data Loading 🚚: Our prepared data finds a home in SQLite3 – a lightweight, versatile database engine. Storage and retrieval made simple and efficient!

💠 Data Visualization 📈: Enter Tableau! Bringing our data to life with interactive dashboards, charts, and graphs. Transforming numbers into insights!

🔍 Key Points:

🔵 Python powers extraction and initial processing.

🔵 SQLite3, our trusty database for storage and retrieval.

🔵 Tableau, the artist that paints our data story vividly.

📁 CSV files play a role too, adding a sprinkle of versatility to our pipeline!
